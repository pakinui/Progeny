Well the experiment went wrong and he was affected.
Before I tell you this I just want you to know everything I do is to protect our son.
Okay ... I never told you because I thought you wouldn't agree but our son has always been normal. Normal strength, normal smarts, normal heart.
But I have always wanted him to better than normal, I wanted him to to be perfect.
The reason I wanted to work as apart of this team so badly was because _____
And I thought we had finally perfected it! A way for our son to become everythign I had ever dreamed of.
We had done so many trials, I didn't want anything to go wrong. It all had to be perfect.
I still didn't want you to know, I knew you would disagree. But I knew that if I made him better you would forgive me.
I even faked the whole 'bring your kids to work day' so that I would have a chance to do procedure and you didn't even question it! It was perfect!!
It was all going well until he got scared and wanted us to stop! How could he ask us to stop when we were so close?!
If he was perfect he wouldn't be scared. If we did the procedure he wouldn't be scared. So I kept going. His screams were so loud. 
Because of all of his unnessesary panicking his heart rate went up and along with that his body temperature. And I guess that little increase in temperature meant the organism could mutate.
It happened so fast, one second I was looking and but not yet perfect son, and the next there was a creature whos whole body was covered in a black liquid.
It started growing and was quickly too big for the operation room and when it broke out it started attacking everyone on sight.
And then the strangest thing started happening... It started reproducing. When when parts of the creatures body got injured it was able to produce a whole new creature.
They looked like bugs, and they were the progeny of what used to be our son. It was disgusting.
That thing is not our son anymore okay! It must be killed. That thing is even less perfect than our son.
Kill it and make sure that it never comes back. I will not have something with my DNA be so imperfect.
