these monsters you have been fighting are able to perform a special move called a dash attack.
you know the creature will be preforming a dash because it starts preparing for the attack by turning blue.
The creature will then dash towards you quickly and the only way to avoid this attack is with a smash(?) performed just before you are hit.
To perform a smash press ___ right before the creature hits you and it will become dazed(?).
