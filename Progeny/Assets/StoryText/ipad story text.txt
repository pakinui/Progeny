Okay, I hope this thing is working I don't have much time.
If you are watching this is means I didn't make it. Everything has gone wrong, it wasn't supposed to happen this way.
My team and I have been doing research to try and __
God, this wasn't supposed to happen. My son ... he ... 
No, don't think about it peoples lived depend on my getting this information to someone who can help.
Whoever is watching this, please don't fault us for our work. We were trying to make something great.
It was supposed to ___
I'm not sure what went wrong but the trial didn't go as expected. We thought at this temperature it would evolve slow enough for us to control.
I guess we underestimated the power of that little shit. It mutated out of control and is currently destroying the lab and everyone in it.
If you manage to kill it please let the world know we didnt want this to happen. Don't paint us to be the villians. We were doing this to help.
The only weakness we have found is its resistance to fire. Fire seems to kill any part of thing it touches.
We could have contained it relatively easy if this lab wasn't built to stop any fraction of a flame.
But it's evolving at a rate faster than anything we had ever expected, its unheard of.
We are all going to die, but please, you have to find it and kill it before it develops an immunity to fire.
For all I know at the time you're watching this video fire may already have no effect on the creature.
If that is the case then there is no point in you even trying. Unless you can go to space, ha. Honestly that probably wouldn't even save you.
Now, if you're not my husband please stop watching the video. 
Please be alive.
Okay, shit. God how do I even begin to explain this?
Honey, I love you, you know that right? And I love our son too.
You know he came to work with me today. 'Bring your kids to work' day and all that. Well ...
Things obviously went wrong and I should have never brought him here. Even you told me not to bring him. How stupid am I, huh?
Well the experiment went wrong and he ...
